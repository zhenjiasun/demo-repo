# Cooking Recipe for easiest french fries
- 2 1/2 pounds (1 1/8 kg) Yukon Gold potatoes (about 6 medium)
- 6 cups (1.4 liters) peanut oil
- Fine sea or table salt

- heavy, deep frying pan
- tray drain

### Steps 
1. Scrub potatoes and dab them dry
2. Cut into 1/4-inch batons 
3. Place in a 4 to 5-quart heavy, deep frying pan or Dutch oven and add oil
4. Turn burner to high and bring oil to a boil, which will take about 5 minutes
5. Cook potatoes for another 15 minutes
6. At this 20 minute mark, you can use tongs or a thin spatula to gently scrape loose any potatoes that have stuck to the pan. 
7. Continue to cook, stirring only if absolutely necessary, for 5 to 10 minutes longer, or until crisp and as golden as you like them. 
8. Use a large slotted spoon or spider to scoop potatoes from and spread them on prepared tray drain, tossing immediately with salt as you do.

# Quadratic Equation
In algebra, a quadratic equation (from the Latin quadratus for "square") is any equation having the form
\[ ax^2+bx+c=0 \]
where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic.

\[ x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

\[ ax^2+bx+c=0 \]
\[4a^2x^2+4abx+4ac=0 \]
\[4a^2x^2+4abx=-4ac\]
\[4a^2x^2+4abx+b^2=b^2-4ac\]
\[(2ax+b)^2=b^2-4ac\]
\[2ax+b= \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}\]
\[2ax= -b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}\]
\[x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]


##Comments and Reflections
I have not used markdown before and I found the assignment quite difficult. Some details for R Markdown are not shown in class. I wish that there was more about writing the r codes in class, so that doing the assignment is much a shock. I took about three hours to complete this HW and the most time consuming part is learning r markdown and finding the right code to type down.
