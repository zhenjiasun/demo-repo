Cooking Recipe for easiest french fries
=======================================

-   2 1/2 pounds (1 1/8 kg) Yukon Gold potatoes (about 6 medium)
-   6 cups (1.4 liters) peanut oil
-   Fine sea or table salt

-   heavy, deep frying pan
-   tray drain

### Steps

1.  Scrub potatoes and dab them dry
2.  Cut into 1/4-inch batons
3.  Place in a 4 to 5-quart heavy, deep frying pan or Dutch oven and add oil
4.  Turn burner to high and bring oil to a boil, which will take about 5 minutes
5.  Cook potatoes for another 15 minutes
6.  At this 20 minute mark, you can use tongs or a thin spatula to gently scrape loose any potatoes that have stuck to the pan.
7.  Continue to cook, stirring only if absolutely necessary, for 5 to 10 minutes longer, or until crisp and as golden as you like them.
8.  Use a large slotted spoon or spider to scoop potatoes from and spread them on prepared tray drain, tossing immediately with salt as you do.

Quadratic Equation
==================

In algebra, a quadratic equation (from the Latin quadratus for "square") is any equation having the form
*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0
 where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic.

$$ x=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0
4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* + 4*a**c* = 0
4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* = −4*a**c*
4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* + *b*<sup>2</sup> = *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c*
(2*a**x* + *b*)<sup>2</sup> = *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c*
$$2ax+b= \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$$
$$2ax= -b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$$
$$x=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

Comments and Reflections
------------------------

I have not used markdown before and I found the assignment quite difficult. Some details for R Markdown are not shown in class. I wish that there was more about writing the r codes in class, so that doing the assignment is much a shock. I took about three hours to complete this HW and the most time consuming part is learning r markdown and finding the right code to type down.
